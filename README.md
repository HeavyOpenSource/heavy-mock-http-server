## üìù Description

This project is a mock HTTP server that can be used to simulate different HTTP responses. Let me list you some use
cases:

* You are developing a client application that consumes a server that is not ready yet
* You are developing a client application that consumes an external service that is too expensive to call during
  development and testing
* You are developing a client application that consumes an external service that is not reliable

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üê≥ Docker

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  heavy-mock-http-server:
    image: heavynimbus/mock-http-server:0.0.0
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      - HEAVY_MOCK_CONFIG=/configs/basic-example.yml
    volumes:
      - ./examples:/configs
```

**Notes**:

* Volumes are used to mount the configuration files to the container, so you can change the configuration without
  rebuilding the image
* The `HEAVY_MOCK_CONFIG` environment variable is used to specify the configuration file that the server should use
* The configuration file is a YAML file that contains the routes and the responses that the server should return,
  see the [configuration](#-configuration) section for more information or the [examples](./examples) directory

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

*Definition*:
```yaml
endpoints:
  - name: <string>

        - <regex>
      headers:
        <string>: <string>

    response:
      delay: <integer> # In milliseconds
      status: <HTTP_STATUS> # OK | CREATED | BAD_REQUEST | ...
      headers:
        <string>:
          - <string>

      body: # Only one field of body can be used
        # You can use the | character to write a multiline string
        string: <string>
        file: <string>
```
